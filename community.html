								<div class="restaurant"> <strong>Miss Mary</strong>Capt. Chip Blackburn.  A good guy and an acquaintance.  People 					like him.  Stay's close in but brings in fish.  http://www.charterboat-missmary.com/
			 					</div>

								<div class="restaurant"> <strong>Charisma Charters</strong> Capt. Chuck Gilford (retired military, ex-mayor of MB, businessman).  Ok, the big bucks, but big Boats too.  Good guy, actually probably the best.  He'll run to the deep water.  But you'll bring in fish.  He has two boats, one run by his son-in-law Danny. He's good too. Trained by Chuck I suspect.  One of the things we enjoy doing is walking down to the docks - they tie up/dock just down the street by the boat ramp when they come in to look at the catch .  People, companies (they take their key employees on an all expense paid trip) etc. plan their year around a trip like that. http://www.charismacharters.com/

				        	<div class="restaurant"><strong>Fish House</strong> - Good food.  Actually almost too much.  Typically, wife and I would split a dinner and order an extra salad.  Full Bar etc.  Very good breakfast on the weekends during the season. <br>
				          	<a href="http://www.fishhousemexicobeach.com/">http://www.fishhousemexicobeach.com/</a>
				      		</div>	

							<div class="restaurant"> <strong>Sharon's Cafe</strong> - The only Breakfast deal (day to day) in town.  It's ok, nothing to write home about.  Their Hamburger Platter for lunch is good.  No credit cards.
							</div>

							<div class="restaurant"><strong>Toucans</strong> - Just past Gulf Foods, across the street from the Exxon. Great beach-front view. Fresh Seafood, bar, family friendly. <br>
									<a href="http://toucansmexicobeachfl.com">toucansmexicobeachfl.com </a>
							</div>
							
							<div class="restaurant"><strong>Sunset Grill</strong> - in Pt. St. Joe:  We have eaten there and it's good. A bit pricey.  More gourmet type stuff. <br >
								<a href="http://www.sunsetcoastalgrill.com/">http://www.sunsetcoastalgrill.com/</a>
							</div>

							<div class="restaurant"><strong>Peppers</strong> - Reid St. in Pt. St. Joe:  Absolutely great Mexican Food.  An entre easily feeds two. <br>
							<a href="http://www.peppersmexicangrillandcantina.com/">http://www.peppersmexicangrillandcantina.com/</a>
							</div>

							<div class="restaurant"><strong>Killer Seafood</strong> - Good, very good. Next to Gulf Foods. Small, owners run everything. No credit cards, erratic hours. Fish Taco delicious.  Probably these days, my favorite eat out place in MB. <br>
							<a href="http://www.killerseafood.net/">http://www.killerseafood.net/</a>
							</div>

							<div class="restaurant"><strong>Mango Marley's</strong> -  Next to Fish House in MB. 25 different wing sauces. Good drinks, burgers, seafood. Another Family friendly place. <br>

						<div class="restaurant"> <strong>Groceries and General Supplies</strong> - Gulf Foods in MB, good meat. The normal stuff you might need. Real Grocery store in Port St. Joe, the Piggly Wiggly.
	 					</div>

						<div class="restaurant"> <strong>The beach across the canal</strong> - You can walk for miles. No development yet, and it's nice. You'll see where they've marked the turtle nests certain times of year.
	 					</div>

						<div class="restaurant"> <strong>The Marina at Pt. St. Joe </strong> - Interesting to walk the docks.  Don't let anyone tell you there isn't money in this country.  Some people like the restaurant there.
	 					</div>

						<div class="restaurant"> <strong>Apalachicola</strong> - 30 mi. east of MB on hwy 98.  Very interesting old town.  Home of the oysters.  Some very interesting shops, old homes, and antique type places.  If you go, be sure to visit the old tin barn antique place down next to the river. Nice walk around town. Some interesting restaurants too. They have the Seafood Festival every year during the first weekend of Nov.  It's a hoot, especially the Oyster Eating Contest. Across the big bridge you come to Eastpoint.  You can buy good fresh seafood and oysters there. The good stuff. 
						</div>

						<div class="restaurant"> <strong>Cape San Blas</strong> -  Voted one of the top 10 beaches in the world.  Half of it is a state park. Take C30A out of Pt. St. Joe and follow the signs. Been there, done that, it doesn't appeal that much to me. To some people it does. It is a pretty beach though. The old Cape San Blas lighthouse is very interesting. The Cape San Blas lighthouse has now been moved to Port St. Joe.
						</div>

						<div class="restaurant">If you smoke, buy your cigarettes in GA. Before you go.  It's about $10.00 a carton higher in FL
	  					</div>

						<div class="restaurant">Buy automobile gas at the AL/FL line.  It's typically .20 cents higher a gallon in FL. Gas these days is cheaper in AL than GA. 
						</div>

						<div class="restaurant">If you like a couple of drinks in the evening, buy enough in GA, it's a lot cheaper.  Beer is about the same.  
						</div>

						<div class="restaurant">The nearest WalMart is in Callaway, back towards PC in case you forget anything. If you have to go to WalMart, then go early and stop at Corams (in Parker, just before Callaway) for breakfast. Their hashbrown casarole is to die for. It'll feed two easy.
	  					</div>

						<div class="restaurant">If you want to cook in w/ seafood, the Shell Shack in MB has fresh stuff and they're not too bad price-wise.
